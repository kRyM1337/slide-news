React web app allowing you to get relevant, constantly updated news articles from multiple sources. More info to come closer to release.<br><br>I started this app so I can grab relevant news and get updated articles based on my topics automatically. The project quickly grew and I decided to make it into a bigger application to help others get news and never have to worry about looking for updated articles based on their interests.<br><br>Version 1.0 will be launching soon with limited news sources and topic filters but I will be expanding it to include much more features (i.e. possibly users, larger news sources integration, sharing / email functionality, categorical views, and other fun things).<br><br>
